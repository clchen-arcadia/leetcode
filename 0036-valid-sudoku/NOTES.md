# Notes

This one was pretty satisfying, it was fairly simple and all about writing thorough instructions to check a well defined condition--something code is very well suited to do. I liked the way I check the 9 small boxes by defining the top-left corner for each small box, and making inline definitions for all 9 small cells. I wonder if there is a more efficient way of doing that, or for generalizing the step of defining a n x n box of cells specified by the top-left corner.
