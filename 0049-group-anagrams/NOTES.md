# Notes

This was a good exercise in Object equality in JavaScript. I did a little research and reviewed referential equality, shallow equality, and deep equality. Shallow equality checking was used in this problem, a deep equality comparison algorithm using recursion was not needed here. 

I wanted to use frequency counters but in the end, using a sorted string to determine if two words belonged in an anagram group together was a huge speed improvement.
